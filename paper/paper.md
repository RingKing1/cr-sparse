# Summary

We introduce `CR-Sparse`, a Python package that enables efficiently solving
a wide variety of sparse representation based signal processing problems.
It has been built using Google JAX [@jax2018github], which enables the same high level
Python code to get efficiently compiled on CPU, GPU and TPU architectures
using XLA.
